# 1 - Hello Blockchain

Let's start with the simplest example, which shows you how to:

1. Build and publish a contract
2. Write data on-chain
3. Read data on-chain

## Example code

Below is the full contract for hello_blockchain.

```move
/// Writes a message to a single storage slot, all changes overwrite the previous.
/// Changes are recorded in `MessageChange` events.
module hello_blockchain::message {
    use std::error;
    use std::signer;
    use std::string::{Self, String};
    use aptos_framework::event;
    #[test_only]
    use std::debug::print;

    /// A resource for a single storage slot, holding a message.
    struct MessageHolder has key {
        message: String,
    }

    #[event]
    /// Event representing a change in a message, records the old and new messages, and who wrote it.
    struct MessageChange has drop, store {
        account: address,
        from_message: String,
        to_message: String,
    }

    /// The address does not contain a MessageHolder
    const E_NO_MESSAGE: u64 = 1;

    #[view]
    /// Reads the message from storage slot
    public fun get_message(addr: address): String acquires MessageHolder {
        assert!(exists<MessageHolder>(addr), error::not_found(E_NO_MESSAGE));
        MessageHolder[addr].message
    }

    /// Sets the message to the storage slot
    public entry fun set_message(account: signer, message: String) acquires MessageHolder {
        let account_addr = signer::address_of(&account);
        if (!exists<MessageHolder>(account_addr)) {
            move_to(&account, MessageHolder {
                message,
            })
        } else {
            let message_holder = &mut MessageHolder[account_addr];
            let from_message = message_holder.message;
            event::emit(MessageChange {
                account: account_addr,
                from_message,
                to_message: message,
            });
            message_holder.message = message;
        }
    }

    #[test(account = @0x1)]
    fun sender_can_set_message(account: signer) acquires MessageHolder {
        let msg: String = string::utf8(b"Running test sender_can_set_message...");
        print(&msg);

        let addr = signer::address_of(&account);
        aptos_framework::account::create_account_for_test(addr);
        set_message(account, string::utf8(b"Hello, Blockchain"));

        assert!(get_message(addr) == string::utf8(b"Hello, Blockchain"));
    }
}
```

## Breakdown

### Module

The first 3 lines here, define documentation and the name of the module. Here you can see that the `///` represents a
doc comment. Documentation can be generated from these comments, where `///` describes what's directly below it.

`module hello_blockchain::message` represents the name of the address, and the name of the module.  `hello_blockchain`
is what we call a named address. This named address can be passed in at compile time, and determines where the contract
is being deployed.  `message` is the name of the module. By convention, these are lowercased.

```move
/// Writes a message to a single storage slot, all changes overwrite the previous.
/// Changes are recorded in `MessageChange` events.
module hello_blockchain::message {}
```

### Imports

Next, we import some libraries that we will use in our contract. The `use` keyword is used to import modules, and are of
the form `use <module_address>::<module_name>`. There are three standard library addresses that we can use from Aptos:

- `std` - The standard library, which contains basic functionality like strings, vectors, and events.
- `aptos_std` - The Aptos standard library, which contains functionality specific to the Aptos blockchain, like string
  manipulation.
- `aptos_framework` - The Aptos framework, which contains functionality specific to the Aptos framework, like events,
  objects, accounts and more.

Note that the `#[test_only]` attribute is used to indicate that the module is only for testing purposes, and will not be
compiled into the non-test bytecode. This is useful for debugging and testing purposes.

```move
use std::error;
use std::signer;
use std::string::{Self, String};
use aptos_framework::event;
#[test_only]
use std::debug::print;
```

### Structs

Next, we define a struct that will hold our message. Structs are structured data that is a collection of other types.
These types can be primitives (e.g. `u8`, `bool`, `address`) or other structs. In this case, the struct is called
`MessageHolder`, and it has a single field to hold the message.

```move
/// A resource for a single storage slot, holding a message.
struct MessageHolder has key {
message: String,
}
```

### Events

Next, we define an event that will be emitted when the message is changed. Events are used to record changes to the
blockchain in an easily indexable way. They are similar to events in other programming languages, and can be used to log
changes to the blockchain. In this case, the event is called `MessageChange`, and it has three fields: `account`, which
is the address of the account that changed the message, `from_message`, which is the old message, and `to_message`,
which
is the new message. The `has drop, store` attributes indicate that the event can be dropped and stored in the
blockchain.

```move
#[event]
/// Event representing a change in a message, records the old and new messages, and who wrote it.
struct MessageChange has drop, store {
account: address,
from_message: String,
to_message: String,
}
```
