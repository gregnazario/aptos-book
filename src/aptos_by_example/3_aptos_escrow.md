# Aptos Escrow

## ðŸª™ Storing Fungible Assets in a Smart Contract

In many decentralized applications, it's essential to store and manage fungible assetsâ€”also known as tokensâ€”within a smart contract. Whether you're building a decentralized exchange (DEX), a staking protocol, or a game economy, you often need to securely hold tokens on behalf of users or the protocol itself.

In this example, we'll demonstrate how to store fungible tokens inside a Move smart contract on Aptos. We'll cover how to:

- Accept deposits of a specific token,
- Store those tokens securely in the contract,
- And (optionally) allow withdrawals under certain conditions.

This pattern forms the foundation of many on-chain financial applications, enabling safe and modular token handling using Moveâ€™s powerful resource-oriented programming model.


## Example code

Below is the full contract for aptos_escrow.

```move
/// # Aptos Escrow Contract

## Breakdown

### Module

The first few lines define documentation and the name of the module. The `///` represents a doc comment. Documentation can be generated from these comments, and each `///` describes what's directly below it.

`module aptos_escrow::aptos_escrow` represents the named address and the module name. `aptos_escrow` is a named address that determines where the module is deployed. The second `aptos_escrow` is the module name. By convention, module names are lowercase and use snake_case.

```move
/// # Aptos Escrow Contract
///
/// This module provides an escrow mechanism between two parties using `FungibleAsset` and `Object` APIs.
/// A sender can lock assets into an escrow object which only the receiver can accept or the sender can cancel.
/// It demonstrates object creation, capability restriction, and asset management using the Aptos framework.
module aptos_escrow::aptos_escrow {
````

### Imports

Next, we import modules needed for the contract. The `use` keyword is used to bring in external modules or types. Imports are of the form `use <module_address>::<module_name>`. Here we use both standard and framework modules.

* `std` - The standard library: contains base utilities like `signer`, `vector`, etc.
* `aptos_framework` - Provides object APIs, fungible asset handling, event emission, etc.

```move
use std::signer::address_of;
use aptos_framework::object::{Self, Object};
use aptos_framework::primary_fungible_store;
use aptos_framework::fungible_asset::{Self, Metadata, FungibleStore};
use aptos_framework::event;
```

### Structs

The `Escrow` struct defines the core data of the escrow. Structs are Moveâ€™s way of defining custom data types. This struct is a resource stored in an object.

```move
#[resource_group_member(group=aptos_framework::object::ObjectGroup)]
struct Escrow has key {
    store: Object<FungibleStore>,
    receiver: address,
    extend_ref: object::ExtendRef,
    delete_ref: object::DeleteRef
}
```

* `store`: Holds the actual escrowed tokens.
* `receiver`: The designated address that can accept the escrow.
* `extend_ref`, `delete_ref`: Capabilities to control the lifecycle of the object (e.g., allow deletion or extension).

### Events

Events allow recording important actions on-chain in a structured way. Here, `EscrowCreatedEvent` logs when an escrow is created.

```move
#[event]
struct EscrowCreatedEvent has store, drop {
    sender: address,
    receiver: address,
    fa: address,
    amount: u64,
    escrow_obj: address
}
```

* `sender`: The address initiating the escrow.
* `receiver`: The recipient of the escrowed assets.
* `fa`: The fungible asset type.
* `amount`: The amount being escrowed.
* `escrow_obj`: The address of the created escrow object.

### Entry Functions

These are public functions users interact with. Each represents a step in the escrow flow.

---

#### `create_escrow`

```move
public entry fun create_escrow(sender: &signer, metadata: Object<Metadata>, amount: u64, receiver: address) {
    ...
}
```

* Withdraws assets from the sender.
* Creates a new object to store the escrowed tokens.
* Locks the tokens and sets lifecycle capabilities.
* Emits `EscrowCreatedEvent`.

---

#### `cancel_escrow`

```move
public entry fun cancel_escrow(sender: &signer, escrow_obj: Object<Escrow>) acquires Escrow {
    ...
}
```

* Checks that the caller is the original sender.
* Withdraws all tokens from the escrow store.
* Deletes the escrow object.
* Returns the tokens back to the sender.

---

#### `accept_escrow`

```move
public entry fun accept_escrow(receiver: &signer, escrow_obj: Object<Escrow>) acquires Escrow {
    ...
}
```

* Validates that the caller is the intended receiver.
* Withdraws the tokens from escrow.
* Deletes the escrow object.
* Transfers the tokens to the receiver.

---

This contract demonstrates secure and object-based escrow logic in Aptos using `FungibleAsset` and `Object` APIs. It also shows how to lock, unlock, and restrict transfer of objects, making it suitable for trust-minimized payment flows.
