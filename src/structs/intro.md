# Using Structs to Structure Related Data

In Move, a `struct` groups related fields into a single type. Structs are the primary way to define custom data types and to model both ephemeral values and on-chain resources. Each struct definition lives inside a module and is either published on-chain or used purely off-chain.

The following sections cover how to define structs, how abilities affect their behavior, how annotations group resources, and how to construct and deconstruct values.
