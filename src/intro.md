# Introduction

The Aptos Book extends the Move book, offering a single resource for design patterns, usage examples, and other
information needed to build on Aptos. It provides context for building on Aptos and can be used entirely offline.

## Get Started

You can jump to any section for a specific topic, but the material is arranged so that readers first learn Aptos
fundamentals and then progress to writing Move contracts.

We recommend working through the chapters in order. Alternatively, use the search bar to find specific topics or
keywords.

## Book Structure

The book is organized into several parts:

1. **Getting Started** - Installation, first contract, CLI basics
2. **Core Language** - Variables, types, functions, ownership, structs, enums, modules
3. **Standard Libraries** - Collections, error handling, generics, testing
4. **Blockchain Concepts** - Events, parallelization, data models, storage, gas
5. **Design Patterns** - Best practices and common patterns
6. **Building with LLMs** - Using AI tools for Aptos development
7. **Reference** - Standard libraries, glossary, appendix

## LLM-Optimized

This book is optimized for consumption by Large Language Models (LLMs). It is published in the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) format alongside the standard HTML, making it directly usable as context for AI-assisted development. See the [Building on Aptos with LLMs](building_with_llms/intro.md) chapter for details.
