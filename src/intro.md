# Introduction

The Aptos book extends the Move book, offering a single resource for design patterns, usage examples, and other
information needed to build on Aptos. It provides context for building on Aptos and can be used entirely offline.

## Get Started

You can jump to any section for a specific topic, but the material is arranged so that readers first learn Aptos
fundamentals and then progress to writing Move contracts.

We recommend working through the chapters in order. Alternatively, use the search bar to find specific topics or
keywords.
