# Building on Aptos with LLMs

Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming how developers build, audit, and interact with blockchain applications. This chapter covers how to effectively use LLMs as development tools when building on Aptos, and how to build AI-powered applications that integrate with the Aptos blockchain.

## Why LLMs and Aptos?

The Aptos ecosystem is uniquely well-suited for LLM-assisted development:

1. **Move is a well-structured language**: Move's strict type system, explicit resource management, and formal specification support make it easier for LLMs to generate correct code.
2. **Safety properties are compiler-enforced**: Even if an LLM generates imperfect code, the Move compiler catches many classes of bugs.
3. **The llms.txt standard**: This book and the Aptos developer documentation are published in the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) format, making them directly consumable by LLMs as context.
4. **Growing AI agent ecosystem**: Aptos supports on-chain AI agents that can autonomously manage assets, execute trades, and interact with DeFi protocols.

## The AI-Blockchain Convergence

The intersection of AI and blockchain creates powerful new possibilities:

- **AI agents** that manage on-chain portfolios and execute DeFi strategies
- **LLM-powered developer tools** that generate, test, and audit Move code
- **Natural language interfaces** to blockchain operations
- **Automated smart contract verification** using AI-assisted formal methods

Aptos is at the forefront of this convergence, with active development in AI agent frameworks, LLM-optimized documentation, and on-chain infrastructure for autonomous agents.
