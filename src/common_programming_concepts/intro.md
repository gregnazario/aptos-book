# Common Programming Concepts

## Introduction

This chapter covers the fundamental programming concepts that form the foundation of Move development on Aptos. These concepts are essential for writing safe, efficient, and maintainable smart contracts.

**Definition 1.1 (Programming Concept)**
A programming concept is a fundamental idea or principle that guides how we structure and organize code to solve problems effectively.

## Core Concepts Overview

The common programming concepts in Move include:

1. **Variables**: Named storage locations that hold values
2. **Data Types**: Classifications that define the nature and operations of values
3. **Functions**: Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks
4. **Comments**: Documentation that explains code behavior
5. **Control Flow**: Mechanisms that determine the order of execution

## Move-Specific Considerations

**Theorem 1.1 (Move Safety Properties)**
Move enforces several safety properties that distinguish it from other programming languages:

- **Resource Safety**: Resources cannot be duplicated or lost
- **Type Safety**: All operations are type-checked at compile time
- **Memory Safety**: No null pointers, dangling references, or buffer overflows
- **Thread Safety**: All values are immutable by default

### Resource-Oriented Programming

**Definition 1.2 (Resource)**
A resource is a special type in Move that represents digital assets with strict ownership semantics. Resources:
- Cannot be copied
- Cannot be dropped
- Must be explicitly moved or destroyed

```move
// Example: A simple resource representing a digital coin
struct Coin has key {
    value: u64,
    owner: address,
}

// Resources must be explicitly handled
public fun create_coin(value: u64, owner: address): Coin {
    Coin { value, owner }
}

public fun destroy_coin(coin: Coin) {
    // Explicit destruction - no automatic cleanup
    let Coin { value: _, owner: _ } = coin;
}
```

### Abilities System

**Definition 1.3 (Ability)**
An ability is a property that can be attached to types to specify what operations are allowed:

- **key**: Can be stored as a top-level value
- **store**: Can be stored inside other values
- **copy**: Can be copied
- **drop**: Can be dropped

**Theorem 1.2 (Ability Composition)**
The abilities system ensures that:
- Resources (no copy, no drop) maintain their safety properties
- Ordinary values can be freely manipulated
- Storage operations are explicit and controlled

## Learning Path

This chapter is organized to build understanding progressively:

1. **Variables**: Start with basic value storage and manipulation
2. **Data Types**: Understand the type system and available types
3. **Functions**: Learn to organize code into reusable units
4. **Comments**: Document code for maintainability
5. **Control Flow**: Control program execution flow

## Best Practices

**Principle 1.1 (Move Best Practices)**
When writing Move code:

1. **Use Resources for Assets**: Represent digital assets as resources
2. **Minimize Abilities**: Only add abilities when necessary
3. **Explicit Ownership**: Make ownership transfers explicit
4. **Type Safety**: Leverage the type system for correctness
5. **Documentation**: Comment complex logic and invariants

## Common Pitfalls

**Warning 1.1 (Common Mistakes)**
Avoid these common mistakes in Move:

1. **Forgetting Abilities**: Not adding required abilities to types
2. **Resource Leaks**: Creating resources without proper cleanup
3. **Type Mismatches**: Using wrong types in operations
4. **Unsafe References**: Creating references that could become invalid
5. **Missing Error Handling**: Not handling potential failures

## Tools and Development

**Definition 1.4 (Development Tools)**
Essential tools for Move development:

- **Move Compiler**: Type checking and compilation
- **Move Prover**: Formal verification
- **Aptos CLI**: Deployment and interaction
- **IDE Support**: Syntax highlighting and error detection

## Conclusion

Understanding these common programming concepts is essential for effective Move development. The Move language's unique features, particularly its resource system and abilities, provide powerful safety guarantees but require careful attention to detail.

The following chapters will explore each concept in depth, providing practical examples and best practices for writing secure and efficient smart contracts.

## Exercises

1. **Exercise 1.1**: Create a simple resource type with appropriate abilities
2. **Exercise 1.2**: Identify the abilities required for different use cases
3. **Exercise 1.3**: Analyze the safety properties of a given Move program
4. **Exercise 1.4**: Compare Move's type system with other programming languages
