# Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in Move smart contract development. This chapter covers patterns that have emerged from the Aptos ecosystem and are considered best practices.

## Patterns Covered

1. **[Account Authorization by Signer](account_authorization_by_signer.md)** - Using signers to control access to resources
2. **[Event Emission](event_emission.md)** - Emitting events for indexing and observability

## Why Patterns Matter

Smart contracts are immutable once deployed and manage real assets. Using well-tested patterns helps you:

- **Avoid common security pitfalls**: Patterns encode lessons learned from real-world exploits.
- **Write idiomatic code**: Other developers can understand your code more easily.
- **Build reliable contracts**: Patterns have been battle-tested across many projects.
