Welcome to the official guide for developers building on the Aptos blockchain.

The Aptos blockchain is a high-performance, scalable, and secure platform designed to support a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) and services. It is built on the Move programming language, a safe and flexible language originally developed for the Diem project.

## Key Features

- **Move Language**: A resource-oriented programming language with strong safety guarantees enforced at compile time.
- **High Throughput**: Parallel execution via BlockSTM enables high transaction throughput.
- **Low Latency**: Sub-second transaction finality.
- **Upgradeable Contracts**: Compatible upgrade policies allow bug fixes and feature additions.
- **On-Chain Randomness**: Built-in randomness for games, lotteries, and fair selection.
- **AI-Ready**: Documentation published in llms.txt format, with a growing ecosystem of AI agent frameworks.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is for developers who want to build on Aptos. It covers everything from setting up your development environment and learning the fundamentals of Move to mastering advanced topics and design patterns. Whether you are writing code by hand or using AI-assisted development tools, this book provides the comprehensive reference you need.
