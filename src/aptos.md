Welcome to the official guide for developers building on the Aptos blockchain.

The Aptos blockchain is a high-performance, scalable, and secure platform designed to support a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) and services. It is built on the Move programming language, a safe and flexible language originally developed for the Diem project.

This book will guide you through everything you need to know, from setting up your development environment and learning the fundamentals of Move to mastering advanced topics and design patterns.
