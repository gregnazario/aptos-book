# Managing Modules and Packages

Move code is organized into **modules** and **packages**. Understanding how to structure, import, and publish your code is essential for building maintainable smart contracts.

- A **module** is the basic unit of code organization -- a named collection of types, functions, and constants published at a specific address.
- A **package** is a collection of modules along with a manifest (`Move.toml`) that specifies metadata and dependencies.
